mIDasGold Patch.txt File

To convert a Tekkit Classic v3.1.2 server to Tekkit Lite v0.5.7 server. 
Tested with mIDasGold v0.2.4

I created this file because I found none of the patch.txt files linked on the forum thread to be 
sufficiently effective. Since I am running "out-of-the-box" versions of Tekkit Classic server and 
Tekkit Lite server, I thought the community could benefit from this as well.

The file has been hand-crafted to cover as much of the two server applications' content as 
possible. I have tested it against my test servers and made tweaks where I found them. Of course,
my world does not use every possible block and I don't have time to test all functions of all 
plugins included in Tekkit Lite. So, I hope folks will contribute when they find additional items 
to be included in the file.

Where items were removed from the game, in some cases, I replaced the item with an item of similar 
utility and value. (i.e. Dark Matter Hammer becomes Diamond Hammer.) I was not thorough with this 
so, feel free to make your own suggestions.

KNOWN BUGS:
I still have not figured out how to get Buildcraft Pipes to translate. After converting, my server 
exhibits symptoms of the infamous "invisible pipes" syndrome. I believe this is because pipes 
employ a little more sophistication than simply adding/changing block/item IDs. I can see what is
happening with NBT Explorer but i do not know where to address the problem. It may be something 
that darkhoernchen can address in the mIDasGold java program but i am not a programmer by trade so 
I couldn't say.

Enjoy!
Adam
